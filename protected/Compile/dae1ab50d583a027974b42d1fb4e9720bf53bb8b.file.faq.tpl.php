                    <p>Assisted Living is a wonderful option for seniors who don’t need or want institutionalized care but do want maximum convenience and opportunities for enrichment.</p>

                    <p>Each resident has an assisted services program tailored to their individual needs. The customized care plan can include daily personal assistance services, such as dressing, bathing, meals, housekeeping, and medication assistance and management.</p>

They are independent but desire the freedom of knowing that the day-to-day details of life will be handled and that they can receive assistance with activities of daily living, like medication assistance, bathing, dressing, and grooming. They like that nutritious menus are created by a registered dietitian and meals are prepared the Executive Chef and that there are many social and enrichment activities available throughout the day.</p>
