				<h2>Beth Rhoden <br><small>Executive Director</small></h2>
				<p>I never really wanted to be a nurse.  I wanted to fly airplanes, but my dad said that was a “job for boys”.  On the heels of this bad news, my best friend convinced me to go to nursing school during our senior year of high school.  I could either graduate early, or enroll in our local community college and stay eligible to run on the track team one last year.  So… nursing it was!</p>
				<p>Turns out, it was my calling – although it took me a few years and a few career changes to figure it out.  Within a short time of graduation, I decided that I didn’t want to get stuck in my west Michigan farm town, so I ran away to visit my sister in Petersburg, Alaska – and immediately got stuck in a fishing village!  Ultimately it was a happy stuck, but that took me awhile to realize too!  I worked in the small 7 bed hospital in Petersburg for a couple of years, then started raising babies.  During my kids younger years, I worked as a travel agent – something that I could do part time and take my son with me while I worked.  I then worked for a chiropractor and realized how much I missed medicine, so became an EMT and ran on the volunteer ambulance crew.  The majority of my calls were 1 am bar fights, but every once in awhile I got to help rescue a life, bring a new life into the world, save a life, or hold a hand at the end of life.  During that time, I started my 10 year career with the Department of Fish and Game.  First as an Admin Assistant for the Division of Habitat, where I learned much about Environmental Impact Statements, the eco-system and about Alaska’s gifts, and the challenges she faced.  From there I transferred into the Division of Sport Fish, then Commercial Fisheries, and finally into the Wildlife Division, where I pulled bear teeth sealed furs and issued hunting/trapping permits.  I had never considered myself much of a “tough girl”, but that job proved me to be just that.  Tough.</p>
				<p>When my marital situation changed, that toughness really kicked in.  I decided that it was time to get back to my “grown up” job of nursing.  I packed my car and hopped on the ferry and sset out for my next adventure.  Back to nursing school – to start over again!</p>
				<p>My nursing career has given me many opportunities – I ran a PCA and respite agency for a few years, and was the Assistant Head Nurse in a Family Practice Clinic for 10 years.  Being a single parent, I spent many years working two jobs – clinic by day, Pioneer Home charge nurse by night.  That renewed my love of the senior population and I jumped at the opportunity when I was offered a position as a Regional Nursing Director for a senior living company based out of Las Vegas.  After a couple of years, I realized how much I missed Alaska, so took a position as a Nurse Liaison for St. Elias Specialty Hospital here in Anchorage.  During my time at St. Elias, I started a healthcare networking group called SPOTLIGHT on Healthcare where I met many wonderful people from all aspects of  healthcare from the Mat Su valley, down to the Central Peninsula.  When I learned that my son was giving me the ultimate gift of a grandbaby, I loaded up and headed BACK down to Las Vegas.  I accepted a position as Memory Care Director, where I was fortunate enough to care for 40-56 seniors with Alzheimers and other cognitive impairments.  Then as Director of Nursing for a 105 bed Assisted Living Facility.  But the biggest during that time of course, was that I was honored to be present for the birth of my first grandchild, Ruthie Grace, and shortly thereafter, grandson Elliott Cole came along.</p>
				<p>I have recently returned once again, home to Alaska.  I am THRILLED to be a part of the Aspen Creek Senior Living family and honored to be in a position where I can help residents transition into this phase of life, and help families adjust to what can be a difficult time.  I am a firm believer that aging is a privilege not given to everyone – and we should honor every minute.</p>
				<p>Aspen Creek Senior Living is a very special place.  From the minute you walk through the doors and into our community, I hope you feel a warm sense of home.  Alaska’s seniors and their families deserve the very best care, and you have my word that OUR family will take great care of YOURS.</p>

				<h2>Adrienne Bradley <br><small>Clinical Director</small></h2>
				<p>I grew up in Utah where I lived close to family until my early 20’s when I married, had a baby, and moved to Fort Hood, Texas. Only 2 months after arriving in Texas, my husband left and deployed to Iraq for over a year. I had never been away from family or alone in my life until then. I applied for and was accepted into nursing school at University of Mary Hardin-Baylor and graduated in 2006 with my Bachelor of Science in Nursing. Nursing school with a toddler, a deployed husband, and no family support was the hardest thing I have done! But as with all trials, many blessings came from this, the biggest one was I became a nurse.</p>
				<p>In nursing school I was always drawn to the elderly population. I’m sure this is because of the close relationship I had with my grandparents and great-grandmother in Utah. After doing a hospice clinical rotation, I realized I wanted to spend my nursing career caring for seniors, so I became a Hospice Case Manager straight out of nursing school. When we moved to San Antonio, I worked in the ICU for a bit to gain some clinical skills. In the ICU, I was always drawn to caring for the dying patients. Due to my husband being in the military, we moved around a lot, so I’ve also worked in Home Health & Hospice in Washington State, Kansas, was an Urgent Care Clinical Manager up in Fairbanks, a Hospice nurse in Kansas, and have recently worked as Home Health & Hospice nurse in Anchorage. I’m super excited about my new role at Aspen Creek where I get to work with seniors on a daily basis.</p>
				<p>I love caring for our elderly population because I feel passionate about ensuring they get the care, compassion, and respect they deserve. I believe our seniors have so much to teach us about life, and I love learning from them. Working in Hospice and end of life care has taught me how precious life is, and that we can find hope, meaning, and quality of life right until the very end.</p>
				<p>When I’m not working, I enjoy spending time with my 3 kids and husband. My absolute favorite thing to do in this world is read. I love going to bookstores and coffee shops whenever I get a chance.</p>
				<p>I am so excited to be a part of the Aspen Creek team as everyone I have met who works here shares my same beliefs.</p>

				<h2>Stephanie Freeman <br><small>Business Office Manager</small></h2>
				<p>My name is Stephanie Freeman and I am the Business Office Manager at Aspen Creek Senior Living. I was born and raised in Palmer, Alaska. After graduating from Palmer High School, I attended college at Mesa State College in Colorado then University of Alaska Anchorage. I took some basic classes, Biology courses and a couple of accounting courses. But since I couldn’t decide on a degree program, I discontinued taking classes. I enrolled in a Certified Nurse’s Assistant course through AVTEC in Anchorage and after graduating went straight to work using my CNA. </p>
				<p>I have worked in many different types of jobs. In healthcare, I’ve worked in an urgent care, with a group of neurosurgeons, and in-home health care. I usually end up working in the offices or as the front desk person where I am able to put my computer skills and medical terminology to good use. Since starting as a Receptionist at Aspen Creek I have grown, learned lots of new roles and promoted to Business Office Manager. I strive to continue learning and bettering myself not only for my own knowledge but also so I can better help the residents in our community here and all of the family members involved in their care.</p>

				<h2>Anna Houser <br><small>Life Enrichment Director</small></h2>
				<p>I attended the University of Wyoming on a Volleyball scholarship where I earned my degree in Child and Family Services. Part of my graduation requirements was a 6 month internship program where I thought I would be placed in an environment to work with children. My ultimate goal was always to work with children and youth.  Instead, I was placed in an assisted living facility helping to run the activities program. I had a great time and fell in love with those sweet residents but still  did not feel it was the direction I should take in my career.</p>
				<p>As luck would have it I had my oldest daughter the semester before I graduated and  spent the next 20 years raising my family and being a stay at home mom. I coached club volleyball on the side as well as doing some catering, sold Pampered Chef and had several other flexible jobs I could do while raising my 4 kids. I was also highly active within my church and spent a significant amount of time coordinating and implementing week long youth retreats, working as a music chorister for the primary children and as an activities specialist for the women I served. I was even a cub master in the Boy Scout Program. Most recently I was working as a special needs para in an elementary school preschool. I loved working with those sweet little ones. I really felt like I had landed where I was supposed to be. Que a job opportunity for my husband in AK.</p>
				<p>The whole move here felt surreal and I spent the first year just trying to settle in to my new reality and make sure my two teenage kids who came with us were getting the things they needed after such a big move. It didn’t take long to realize this was a home and state we were going to love. I felt ready to find my own purpose here in AK. I set about trying to find a job that I would not only be good at but that had meaning and purpose. The core of my nature is to serve and love and I wanted to find a job that was in need of my specific talent and abilities.</p>
				<p>I knew when I walked through the doors at Aspen Creek I had found what I was looking for. My mother had a stroke when she was 62 and needed lots of care for the 16 years she lived with her new reality. 3 years before she passed my dad was diagnosed with ALS and again our world was rocked. So many questions about how he would be cared for how how his remaining time would look. Those experiences with my parents truly sensitized me to the plight of the elderly. The way they were treated by doctors and those they came in contact with all became a source of concern. Many times we had to fight for specific services and get help that no one felt was necessary. When I walked through the doors of Aspen Creek and met the staff and learned about their ideals and goals for the facility I knew it was a place I would have put my own parents and I wanted to be a part of it.</p>

				<h2>Jericho Mandani <br><small>Executive Chef</small></h2>
				<p>I cooked my first dish when I was 8 years old, it was Salisbury steak. I tried it in a local fast food chain back in the Philippines that sparked my curiosity in the culinary world. Growing up, I never had any formal kitchen training. Everything I did was through observation and self-study until I got my first cooking job. I have so much passion for cooking, but I did not have the resources to go to a culinary school until I met my mentor Luke Gilligan back in 2012. I trained with him about the management side of the job, I then preceded to stagiaire on fine dining restaurants around town for 2 years. I learned French, Italian and Asian cuisine from the top chefs of Alaska.</p>
				<p>In 2014 I was hired as a Sous Chef at Crowne Plaza and got promoted to become the Executive Chef after 2 months. Since then I have been participating and able to win multiple awards from cooking competitions, the recent one was the “Soup R Bowl” soup contest and I also have been nominated twice as Kitchen Manager of the year at the Stars of the Industry (Alaska Hotel and Lodging Association). While I grow and establish my name in the culinary industry in Alaska, I still work hard to learn different techniques and styles of cooking. For me learning will never stop. I try to learn from everyone, be it on a professional kitchen or home kitchen. I get great pleasure out of seeing happy faces enjoying the meal that I prepared.</p>
				<p>As a chef, my goal is to serve the best plate possible considering nutrition demands and dietary restrictions. Working for our seniors gives me a sense of fulfillment. Because I was not given the opportunity to do what I do best to my own grandparents.</p>
				<p>My family is what drives me to become better in everything I do. My wife, as my support and my kids are my greatest critic. Other than being a family man and a chef, I am also a musician and an artist. I think combining all my talents is what separates me from the other chefs out there. My love for cooking, passion for music, plus the soul from my art, I think we got the perfect recipe.</p>
				<p>I am grateful to be part of the Aspen Creek team and I give 100% to provide the best dining experience for our residents.</p>

				<h2>Tami Ochoa <br><small>Admission Coordinator</small></h2>
				<p>Born and raised in Alaska. As an adolescent we lived here in Anchorage and traveled with my father to different cities and towns during the summer while he was in charge of building many of the roads in Alaska for the Department of Transportation. During these years I was blessed to watch my parents support each other and show me how love and compassion can see you through good times as well as trials. We also had a strong presence of faith in our home then and to this day. My life was formed by love, compassion, belief that everyone is special and we all need to be take care of each other no matter what the differences may be in our lives. I have always cherished these teachings and have had the dream of being able to give back just a small amount of these gifts to everyone I meet.</p>
				<p>My early adult years were spent married and raising my children. As long as I can remember I have wanted to take care of people. To bring happiness, ease their pain, share their joys, and comfort them in their sorrows. Naturally once my children were grown and all in school I decided to pursue a career in the medical field.</p>
				<p>I worked for 19+ years in Skilled Nursing and loved being the one people came to when they needed love, help, comfort and care. A year ago my life changed, I was at a crossroad in my career, I took a break from Skilled Nursing and then I was approached to join this team at Aspen Creek Senior Living. Their vision was also mine. Compassion, Love, Giving, and Creating a place where people who need help can live and age in place.</p>
				<p>I am blessed again in my life to be surrounded by people who have the Compassion, Love and a Genuine dream to Care for our Seniors and all of the residents in our community that are in need of assistance. We are here to enrich lives, share stories, enable dreams, allow families to become family again and allow us to care for their loved ones.</p>

				<h2>Kemish W. Hendershot <br><small>Chief Operating Officer/Owner</small></h2>
				<p>After attending school at Boise State University, my early career was spent working in construction, initially framing homes and then as a custom home builder, until the summer of 2009 when I had an experience that would change the course of my life.</p>
				<p>Just like everyone working in the construction industry, the great recession starting in 2007 affected my business. In the summer of 2009, I was working on a small remodel project and was self-performing some of the work. On the last day, while putting up the last piece of material I was walking across a metal roof and it started to rain. I slipped, fell two stories and hit my head on a landscaping rock. A week later I awoke in the hospital, tried to get out of bed to go to the bathroom, fell over and didn’t understand why I couldn’t walk; I discovered I had suffered a traumatic brain injury. After a month of physical therapy, learning again to write, walk and accomplish normal everyday tasks, I was sent home with a walker to continue recovery on my own.</p>
				<p>I quickly recognized that I would not be able to continue, at least for some time, building homes and I began to search for other ways I could provide for my family. Due to the experiences I had during my recovery and the recognition that without excellent health care providers I would not be alive, I was drawn to the health care field. After searching for employment and additional recovery time, I was given the opportunity to do some part-time work for a health care company operating skilled nursing facilities. I worked hard, did a good job, and the work load progressed into full-time employment and eventually I became the Director of Information Technology for Advanced Health Care.</p>
				<p>During my time as Director of IT, I managed information technology for fourteen locations across the Western United States, created a proprietary electronic health record application, developed public facing websites, and built business specific, mission-critical applications.</p>
				<p>Throughout my experiences, I have maintained the position that technology is a tool which should be used to improve processes making individuals more efficient so that, specifically in health care, providers can spend their valuable time with patients in ways that effect positive change; I believe that while technology can be an invaluable tool, it cannot and should not replace the personal relationships created through one-on-one interactions.</p>
				<p>I am excited to be back in Alaska and to utilize the experiences that I have had throughout my life from construction and real estate to health care and information technology to be a part of something revolutionary. We are creating a community that will provide our seniors, our staff, and the families of both with experiences, opportunities, and relationships that will change their lives; we are redefining senior living in the State of Alaska.</p>
				<p>I have a Bachelors Degree in Business Management, served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Tucson, Arizona, speak Spanish, and when not working, love being outdoors mountain biking, kayaking, fly fishing, skiing, or hunting. However, more than anything, I enjoy spending time with my wife of 20 years and our four children.</p>

				<h2>Doug Clegg <br><small>Chief Executive Officer/Owner &amp; Founder</small></h2>
				<p>In 1991, I graduated in construction management and was hired as a project manager for a residential development company in Northern California. A year later, I relocated my new family and ventured into site development and general engineering.</p>
				<p>There is an art of creation and an euphoria that comes with visualizing, drawing and then physically building something. It’s an unbelievable feeling that never leaves your system once you have tasted it. Deep down I knew there was something more to my career than tasting dirt and making money.</p>
				<p>I spent the next three years creating a new corporation, obtaining a commercial general engineering license and meeting bonding requirements. During that time, we had a beautiful baby girl.</p>
				<p>One night I received a phone call from a friend. He was working as a home health aid in the new concept of “Assisted Living.” It was unregulated comparative to skilled nursing facilities, and it represented a new paradigm for long-term care; “A life like home, without the institutional feel.”</p>
				<p>He told me to come up and take a look. I flew out and spent time touring facilities. That is when I discovered my new love, my new career. Together, we spent months developing plans, looking for locations and establishing our business model. We commenced construction and opened our first facility in Soda Springs, Idaho in 1995.</p>
				<p>It was a new start, an adventure and then came the truth – we were fully occupied and still loosing money. After 18 months and sleepless nights, we realized that our seniors needed more care and we needed more staff. We knew we needed to do something different. We introduced a negotiated services agreement (an NSA).</p>
				<p>We developed descriptions for three levels of care. Each level had different needs; which became known as the need for adequate care, the need for adequate compensation, and the need to compensate the owners for the risk and time that it takes to manage a business. Shortly after this, we began construction on our second facility in Montpelier, Idaho. This time time we knew we needed to start with more rooms and our newly created NSA.</p>
				<img src="<?php echo htmlspecialchars($_smarty_tpl->tpl_vars['IMAGES']->value, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');?>
/facilities/aerial.jpg" alt="" class="float-right img-fluid">
				<p>We heard rumblings of a new HCBS waiver program through the Idaho Assisted Living Association (IDALA). We were approached by the commissioner of health and welfare and asked if we would pilot this.</p>
				<p>We accepted the invitation and used our NSA and some very basic excel spreadsheets. These simple practices became the data that the state used to create a point system, which became their now universal assessment instrument (UAI), which is still used to establish a care rate for acuity after rent, food and utilities (RUF) have been considered.</p>
				<p>We learned a lot these first three years. We realized we had a newly introduced care model that was not only in demand but a blessing to those that we provided services for.</p>
				<p>Finally we were paying the bills. Then three years and three children later, my wife and I determined we needed to relocate our family to Boise, Idaho.</p>
				<p>Shortly after relocating to Eagle Idaho, I purchased a map of the state of Idaho. I then pasted it on an office cork-board. The next day I purchased three colors of thumbtacks and posted the two facilities we currently owned in red on the map.</p>
				<p>I then went to the states’ websites and printed a report that showed every assisted living facility in the state. I began putting thumbtacks on their locations. This visual allowed me to understand what the State of Idaho meant for our future. We then began by placing yellow thumb tacks for facilities over 16 beds and green thumb tacks over facilities with less than 15 beds.</p>
				<p>We realized that if there was no hospital our chances of survival were weak. Based on the map, we began construction in American Falls, then Eagle, Saint Anthony, Meridian, Boise and the list went on. Our communities began training to provide care for Alzheimer and Dementia and then independent living. We began buying larger properties to create campuses. By 2010, we became one of the five largest Assisted Living providers in the State of Idaho.</p>
				<p>During this adventure we got involved with initiatives that included The Department of Health and Welfare and the ongoing need to change rules and regulations, reimbursement rates and other legislative initiatives that are essential to staying in tune with a healthy ever changing industry. Our association became affiliated with a national organization, the Assisted Living Federation of America (ALFA). We attended national conventions that gave us access to leading edge practices, technology and quality assurance initiatives.</p>
				<p>We became affiliated with the National Investment Council (NIC), which has a broader base and involves not only assisted living, but skilled nursing. We learned a lot, but then something happened. I was at a convention in Florida. There are usually several keynote speakers, like a Colin Powell or a Newt Gingrich. Once in a while, these keynote speakers will be what we call an “unknown.”</p>
				<p>I do not remember the name of the individual this day, but I do remember he started out by introducing himself as a fellow operator who was running our large CCRV in the state of New York. He began to give us a history of evolutionary change in the American Economy.</p>
				<p>We started as farmers and hunters, then goods and services, then we began mining natural resources through the gold rush, then manufacturing and then the industrial revolution and then he introduced the… “experience” industry. I was taken back for a minute as he began sharing the evolution of Broadway, which eventually led to Hollywood and the film industry; then, a guy by the name of Walt Disney who created a “theme park” and then the hotel and hospitality industry. He went on and on and began to explain how goods and services were no longer marketed through needs but experience and desires.</p>
				<p>Sex sells beer and cigarettes, beauty sales clothing and cosmetics, Hollywood sells emotions. Then he asked what we were? Where did we belong in the continuum of the economy? How were we classified as an industry? Were we goods with our food? Were we services with our care plans? Did we fall under the hospitality industry with our elaborate real estate as we tried to one up each other with new designs that had curb appeal?</p>
				<p>I personally thought we were a health care industry and fell under the direct line of services. I stood corrected, and realized that we as a company were falling short of our potential. We do have an obligation to provide an experience. We went home from this convention and fired our marketing directors. We called in all of our Executive Directors (Administrators) who formed our board of leadership and redefined their role. It required us to create new job descriptions for them, for their nurses and for their staff supervisors.</p>
				<p>Our activity directors became life coaches and when they planned events and activities more than just the resident was considered in the planning. We hired Meredith St. Clair who was working on her doctorate in Gerontology and teaching troubled teenagers in the Boise School System. We spent the summer of 2006 writing the curriculum for what we eventually called “Ohona” which in the islands means family and within the family unit – that we are bound together as a community.</p>
				<img src="<?php echo htmlspecialchars($_smarty_tpl->tpl_vars['IMAGES']->value, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');?>
/facilities/spring-creek-sign.jpg" alt="" class="float-left img-fluid">
				<p>This curriculum was brought to our newly energized life coaches. We began to infuse the community and school with the knowledge behind our residents. The story of the sinking of the titanic was told through the grand daughter of the lead finish carpenter who still had some of her fathers’ tools. We told the stories of the WWII conflict with fully dressed decorated veterans. Children learned of these experiences firsthand in the classroom. The educational value behind our residences’ experiences was invaluable to the community.</p>
				<p>We developed personalized software system that utilized retail scanning technology with picture images, electronic scanning bars and medication distribution. This became to be knows as “AutoMar” and is sold today nationally as one of the leading medication management software systems known as “QuickMar”.</p>
				<p>It will take another time for us to share all that we did, but suffice it to say that the need to go and find people to live with us no longer existed within our organization. The health of our seniors improved, the culture in our communities transformed and we began receiving letters from extended family who had been a part of this experience for our seniors.</p>
				<p>We began to see within our facilities a culture change. The need to discipline for endless peer criticism and backbiting diminished. Caregivers and cooks began to work together. Activities became a family event and our mothers’ day, fathers’ day and other similar days of recognition became a family event, not only for the residents, but for the staff as everyone united.</p>
				<p>As all stories have a beginning, they also have an end. As we became one of the larger long term care providers, it soon became a reality that I was spending most of my time dealing with lenders, investors, attorneys and insurance adjusters. I knew that we had grown to the point that we needed a fresh start and a new set of relationships.</p>
				<p>We spent six months developing an offering memorandum with all of the details required to attract larger investors and operators. It took us a year following this offering memorandum to finally sale our organization to a REIT.</p>
				<p>We entered into a non compete for three years and since our sale in September 2011 have used our investment and development skills to create single family developments, multi family apartment projects, fast food establishments, convenience stores, reclamation projects, and other commercial retail and business ventures.</p>
				<p>It has always been our intention to return to the senior market and begin the journey we started in 1994 in South Eastern Idaho. We have learned much over the past 22 years as owners, operators, developers, and investors in the senior long term care industry. It is our belief that there is something to be done in the State of Alaska. The condition of the long term care industry is almost what we felt when we started in Idaho, and the seniors along with their families are seeking for something more than just quality care.</p>
				<p>All of us as we reach the age when the pendulum shifts from being children to being a primary care provider for our parents has a new set of decisions to make. The tools for long-term care are closely tied to these decisions, and what it means to us as individuals and our interactions with our parents.</p>
				<p>Our role as long-term care providers is much deeper than just documentation, adequate training, clean facilities and good meals. It is tied to the ability to counsel with the public about the decisions they need to make individually since every family, every individual and every health care condition is a private matter and vastly different.</p>
				<p>We have found that the decision to accept long-term care services is not an event but a process even after it has been made. Creating and using the tools to keep our seniors involved with their community, with their family and with the greater world which they are a part of is what transforms this decision to accept long term care from an event and keeps it a healthy and evolutionary process.</p>
				<p>These tools are not in addition to providing excellent care, but a change in how that excellent care is administered. Every individual has a song to sing or a dance to engage in, and discovering this within our seniors and then giving them the instruments to play at their level of talent and ability is what is needed for them until their final breath.</p>
				<p>We are excited to be working within the State of Alaska and hope we can offer what we began to experience to those that we serve in Anchorage.</p>
